# LeetCode Mini

## Overview

LeetCode Mini is a work-in-progress project aimed at creating a simplified version of the popular coding challenge platform, LeetCode. This project is designed to help users practice coding problems for technical interview preparation and programming contests. I want this to become a unique platform in the sense it combines Codeforces and LeetCode together in a modern web aesthetic.

## Features (To be added)

- User authentication and profile management/metrics display
- A collection of coding problems categorized by difficulty (500 - 2000). Each problem will have a runtime and memory limit described in big-O notation
- Code editor with syntax highlighting
- Real-time code execution and result display
- Problem submission and solution tracking
- Discussion forum
- Contests with rewards and user ELO
